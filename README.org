* Simple Server

A toy repository to demonstrate important concepts in building
an HTTP api service in clojure.

* Usage

Start the server using: lein repl

Go to http://localhost:3001 to access the home page and confirm the server is working.

From there the page will prompt you to create an account and subsequently play the game.

If it doesn't connect, clearing your cache may help.
